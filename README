# Sparkify song play aggregation

Sparkify currently stores song play instance data in log form in a series of json files on disc.
This instrumentation loads the song play records as well as the song records themselves (also in
json format on disc to begin with) into a postgres star schema

## Postgres

Both the default database name and postgres root user name are "postgres" instead of "student",
when attempting to compose testing utilities for the etl scripting this will need to be considered.
